# basic-information-website

This website was built back in 2018 high school when I was in the IT course here in Lisbon, Portugal.<br>
The purpose of this website was to present a creative portuguese project about "Os Maias", a history written by EÃ§a de Queiroz, and since we were in an IT course and the area I liked the most was Web Development, I decided to make a simple website for this portuguese "exam" project.<br>
<br>
I'm uploading this simple website because it makes part of my progress on this area so I think its important and interesting to let people know how I began! And also because it can be useful for me or someone else who needs a simple idea or a simple code line that this website may have.<br>
